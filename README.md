# Arranging products - API Assiment

I built an API to simulate the connection with the server.
the server contains two files

the product file - contains all the products in the store + their attributes
the discount file - contains the data about the discount at the store

the project goals are:
  1. get the data from the local server (fetch from JSON file).
  2. show the products to the user
  3. with the click of a button the user will be able to see if there is a discount
